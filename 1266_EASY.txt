# 1266. Minimum Time Visiting All Points
# On a plane there are n points with integer coordinates points[i] = [xi, yi]. Your task is to find the minimum time in seconds to visit all points.
# You can move according to the next rules:
# In one second always you can either move vertically, 
# horizontally by one unit or diagonally (it means to move one unit vertically and one unit horizontally in one second).
# You have to visit the points in the same order as they appear in the array.
